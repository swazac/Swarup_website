            My name is Swarup Zachariah and Iâ€™ve been working in the software
            engineering industry for the past 8 years. I have delighted clients
            with projects in aviation, healthcare, and simulation industries.
            With a bachelors and masters in mechanical engineering, my
            professional experience was geared towards improving software for
            my former employers, Infosys and Ansys in the areas of design and
            testing, respectively. I am particularly interested in
            developing React based applications to quickly build efficient and
            scalable designs. I am really excited to bring my skills to deliver
            for your organization.
